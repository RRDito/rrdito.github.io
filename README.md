- ### Phase transitions in tumor growth. Cancer Glycolytic Oscillations.

[Link to article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437117306404) 

Experimental evidence confirms the existence of glycolytic oscillations in cancer, which allows it to self-organize in time and space far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and provides it with high robustness, complexity and adaptability. A kinetic model is proposed for HeLa tumor cells grown in hypoxia conditions. It shows oscillations in a wide range of parameters. Two control parameters (glucose and inorganic phosphate concentration) were varied to explore the phase space, showing also the presence of limit cycles and bifurcations. The complexity of the system was evaluated by focusing on stationary state stability and Lempel–Ziv complexity. Moreover, the calculated entropy production rate was demonstrated behaving as a Lyapunov function.

## Web Scraping <a name="web-scraping"></a>

- ### Pro Dota 2 Matches Dota Fantasy Points Database

[Project in Github](https://github.com/RRDito/Dota-Fantasy-Database)

Fantasy Points are a measure of the performance of a Dota 2 player in a match. While is a consensus among the Dota 2 community that these points don't accurately reflect how well a player performed in such a complicated game, they have an alternative use during the Dota 2 Pro Circuit. In these tournaments the fans can obtain trading cards and form a Fantasy Roster and compete with others by accumulating fantasy points depending on the players performances.

This app written in Python uses web scraping to extract the Fantasy Points statistics of Dota 2 pro matches. Has a simple interface to gather the data from webpages most commonly used by the community. Subsequently, allows to browse the Database and compare two player performances.

###### Comparison between two players (Fantasy Points vs Match Length)
